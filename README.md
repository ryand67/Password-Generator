# Password-Generator

DEPLOYED: https://ryand67.github.io/Password-Generator/

OVERVIEW:

In this project I created an app that prompts the user for criteria for a password, then takes their input and generates a password that meets their specified requirements for the password.

ABOUT:

In the script.js there are comments that walk through the entire project and specific logic.  But generally speaking, I take in the user input, then store the input in an array, which then translates to a specific set of characters to randomly pull from.  Then I generate random numbers to pull random characters from that array, validate that all of the specifications were met and then present the generated password!
